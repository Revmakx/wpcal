## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can invitees book from mobile devices?

Yes. The booking experience is mobile-friendly.

### How can I avoid last‑minute bookings?

Set a Minimum Scheduling Notice (e.g., 24 hours) in the event type settings. Invitees will only see slots at least that far into the future.
